## Features

- üìÑ PDF document processing with OCR
- üìö Multi-document conversation context with filtering
- üéØ Click-to-view document references with highlighting
- üíæ Milvus DB with billions of vectors scale support
- üåê Slick web interface
- üîÑ Large documents processing and status updates


## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](./docs/assets/workflow.png)

The application is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **BFF (Backend for Frontend)**: API gateway handling client requests
- **Index Service**: Processes and indexes documents
- **Query Service**: Handles question answering using RAG
- **Marker Server**: Converts PDFs to markdown format
- **Web App**: React-based frontend interface
- **Milvus**: Vector DB for storing embeddings
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational DB for metadata storage

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn
- **Backend**: Bun
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Milvus
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini (LLM), HuggingFace Transformers (Embeddings)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Google Cloud API key for Gemini

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renton4code/pdf-rag.git
cd pdf-rag
```

2. Set up environment variables:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
```

3. Build and start the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`


## Usage

1. **Upload Documents**
   - Drag and drop PDF files into the web interface
   - Toggle OCR processing for scanned/handwritten documents
   - Monitor processing status in real-time

2. **Chat Interface**
   - Start new conversations
   - Filter documents for specific contexts
   - View document references in responses
   - Click references to view source documents
  
## Common Issues

### Document Processing

- Index step is stuck or failing with OCR: Marker consumes a lot of RAM, so make sure you have enough memory allocated to Docker. Increase RAM limit in Docker Desktop to at least 16GB.

- Inacurate OCR: Marker supports LLM flag improving accuracy, you may want to add the flag to Docker comand:
```CMD ["python", "-m", "marker_server", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8001", "--use_llm", "--gemini_api_key" "<your-gemini-api-key>"]```

### Querying

- Wrong referenced page (off by one): Text chunks intentionally overlap to provide more context to LLM. It can happen that referenced text is from the previous or next page. You may want to tweak the `text2chunks` function in the `services/index/index.ts` file to change the overlap or disable it.

- No results or broken references: Double check the system prompt in the `services/query/index.ts` file. JSON structure depends on the prompt, so promt changes may break the parsing of the response.

## Local Development

### Change the embedding model

- Change the embedding model in the `services/index/embedder.ts` file
- Change the vector dimensions in the `services/index/milvus-client.ts` file

### Change the LLM provider/model/prompt

- Change the LLM in the `services/query/index.ts` file
